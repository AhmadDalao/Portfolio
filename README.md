## Getting Started

<br>
<br>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

You'll need **Git** and **Node.js** (which comes with npm) installed on your computer.

```
node@v10.16.0 or higher
npm@6.9.0 or higher
git@2.17.1 or higher
```
<br>
<br>

## How To Use

From your command line, clone and run Portfolio as following:

```
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/AhmadDalao/Portfolio.git

# Go into the repository
$ cd Portfolio

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

#Start the development server
$ npm start
```

<br>
<br>

## Change and customize every section according to your need.

To get personalized page content navigate to  **`src/portfolioData.js`** and just and modify the data inside to get your personal portfolio. Feel free to use it as-is or customize it as much as you want.

```
const colorContainerData = {
  fontIcon: "fas fa-cog",
  paragraphOne: `Choose your favorite color`,
  paragraphTwo: `default color`,
};

const defaultColor = {
  defaultColor: "#2ecc71",
};

const colorList = [
  { id: 1, color: "#fb7813" },
  { id: 2, color: "#f54291" },
  { id: 3, color: "#0779e4" },
  { id: 4, color: "#efa8e4" },
  { id: 5, color: "#fd5e53" },
];
